The solution depends on the root cause of the conflict.  Here are a few approaches:

**1. CSS Specificity Override:** If the conflict is due to custom CSS or another library overriding Tailwind's styles, use more specific selectors in your Tailwind classes or add `!important` (use sparingly!).

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 !important"> ... </div> // Use !important cautiously
```

**2. Namespace Management:**  For projects involving multiple CSS frameworks, consider namespacing your classes to prevent conflicts. This might involve prefixing Tailwind classes or using a CSS-in-JS solution that handles namespacing automatically.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<div className="my-app-bg-gray-200 p-4"> ... </div> // Example of namespacing
```

**3. Framework-Specific Solutions:** Depending on the framework (React, Vue, etc.), investigate its documentation to see if it provides ways to manage CSS conflicts, often through configuring how Tailwind's directives are processed or integrated with other CSS solutions.  For example, in React you might explore styled-components or other solutions to mitigate naming conflicts.

**4. CSS Preprocessor Configuration:** Ensure that your CSS preprocessor (e.g., PostCSS) is correctly configured to handle Tailwind directives and that there are no conflicting settings affecting how Tailwind styles are generated or applied.
